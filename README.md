# CompNet - Keras Implementation

## Tool:CompNet: Segmenting diffusion brain MRI

The code for training, as well as the Trained Models are provided here.
The model is trained on 1500 b0 diffusion volumes.

Let me know if you face any problems running the code by posting in Issues.

### Model Architecture
The proposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and have three pathways.
> 1) Segmentation Branch - learns what is the brain tissue and to generate a brain mask 
> 2) Complementary Branch - learns what is outside of the brain and to help the other
branch generate brain mask
> 3) Reconstruction Branch - It provides direct feedback to the segmentation and
complementary branche and expects reasonable predictions from them as input to reconstruct the original input image.

### Multi View Aggregation step:
> The approach is to train 3 separate networks for three principal axes ( Sagittal, Coronal and axial ) and 
to perform multi-view aggregation step that combines segmentations from models trained on 2D slices along three principal axes: coronal, sagittal and axial. The final segmentation would be obtained by combining the probability maps from all three segmentation.
